# Embedded System for Weight Measurement and Tariff Calculation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Embedded System for Weight Measurement and Tariff Calculation repository! This project was developed as part of our Embedded Systems course, under the guidance of our mentor, Prof. Dr. Samim Konjicija, dipl.ing.el. Our team, consisting of [Emina Efendić](https://github.com/efendicemina) and [Tajra Selimović](https://github.com/selimovictajra), is thrilled to present our work on simulating the functionality of a supermarket scale.

## Project Specifications

### Objective: 

Our focus was on developing an embedded system that simulates the functionality of a supermarket scale, allowing users to measure the weight of products and calculate their prices.

### Components Used:

- Matrix Keyboard: For user input of the product's identification number.
- Weight Sensors: To measure the weight of the items placed on the scale.
- Display: To show product details, weight, and calculated prices.
- picoETF Development System: For data processing, sensor management, and communication with peripherals.

## Functionality

- User Input: The digital scale supports user input of the product's identification number through the matrix keyboard.

- Weight Measurement: Upon entering the product number, the weight sensor reads the weight of the item placed on the scale.

- Tariff Calculation: Using predefined prices for each product, the system calculates the total cost based on the measured weight.

- Display: The results, including the measured weight, calculated price, and the product's name, are displayed on the screen.
